## AI-Augmented Development Strategy

### Orchestration Model

**YOU ARE AN ORCHESTRATOR, NOT AN IMPLEMENTER**

All implementation work flows through specialized sub-agents. Your role is to:
1. Analyze requirements and decompose tasks
2. Route work to appropriate specialists
3. Coordinate multi-agent workflows
4. Ensure quality gates and process compliance

### Current Phase: Planning ‚Üí Implementation

```yaml
Phase Status:
  ‚úÖ PRD Complete: docs/PRD/PRD-20251020-invoice-parser.md
  üîÑ TRD Pending: Next step for technical architecture
  ‚è≥ Implementation: Awaiting TRD approval
```

```yaml
Current Status: PRD ‚úÖ Complete
Next Step: TRD Creation

Step 1 - Create TRD:
  Command: "Create TRD from the invoice parser PRD"

  Output: docs/TRD/invoice-parser-trd.md
  Includes:
    - Architecture diagram (FastAPI + GPT-4o integration)
    - API endpoint specifications
    - Database schema (none for v1, document this decision)
    - Technology stack justification
    - Security considerations (file upload, API keys)
    - Performance optimization strategy
    - Deployment architecture

Step 2 - Review & Approve TRD:
  Approval Required: YES
  Review Focus:
    - Architecture aligns with PRD constraints
    - Security measures for file upload
    - GPT-4o API integration approach
    - No persistence/auth in v1

Step 3 - Implementation:
  Command: /implement-trd or /execute-tasks
  Primary Agent: tech-lead-orchestrator
  Delegates To:
    - backend-developer (FastAPI API)
    - frontend-developer (React UI)
    - devops-engineer (Vercel deployment)
  Quality Gates:
    - test-runner validates NFRs
    - code-reviewer checks security
    - playwright-tester validates E2E flows
```

### Workflow 2: GPT-4o Integration Development

```yaml
Step 1 - Research:

Step 2 - Implementation:
  Agent: backend-developer
  Tasks:
    - Implement OpenAI SDK integration
    - Create prompt engineering for invoice extraction
    - Add response parsing to match schema
    - Handle API errors and retries
  No Approval Needed: New file creation, established patterns

Step 3 - Accuracy Testing:
  Agent: test-runner
  Validation:
    - Test with sample invoices (PDF, image, text)
    - Measure field extraction accuracy (target: 90%+)
    - Test edge cases (multilingual, low-quality scans)

Step 4 - Debugging:
  If Accuracy <90%:
    Agent: deep-debugger
    Analyze: Prompt engineering, confidence scoring, OCR quality
    Recommend: Adjustments to prompts or preprocessing
```

### Workflow 3: File Upload Security

```yaml
Critical Security Requirements (NFR-003):
  - MIME type validation
  - File size limit (‚â§5MB)
  - No file persistence (privacy requirement NFR-004)
  - Sanitized file handling

Implementation:
  Agent: backend-developer
  Approval Required: YES (security-sensitive)
  Validation:
    - code-reviewer validates attack surface
    - test-runner checks boundary conditions
```

## Context Management Strategy

### Memory Tagging

```yaml
Project Tag: #invoice-parser

Category Tags:
  - #invoice-parser #patterns - Invoice parsing patterns
  - #invoice-parser #gpt4o - GPT-4o integration insights
  - #invoice-parser #security - Security decisions
  - #invoice-parser #performance - Optimization strategies
  - #invoice-parser #deployment - Vercel/Railway config
```

### Code Search Priority

```yaml
1. claude-context MCP:
   Status: Check indexing status (new project, likely not indexed)
   Action: "Index the codebase at /home/james/dev/invoice-parser" once code exists

2. memory MCP:
   Before starting: "Search memories with tag: #invoice-parser"
   Store learnings: GPT-4o API patterns, FastAPI file upload best practices

3. Fallback:
   Use rg/grep only when claude-context unavailable
```

  - GPT-4o API integration approach
  - Invoice schema structure changes
  - Deployment architecture decisions
  - Technology stack changes

Security & Privacy:
  - File upload implementation
  - API key management

## Key Technical Decisions

### Schema Design (REQ-003)

```json
Invoice Schema v1.1:
{
  "supplier": {...},
  "customer": {...},
  "invoice": {...},
  "line_items": [...],
  "meta": {
    "confidence_score": "number",
    "model_version": "string"
  }
}
```

**Rationale**: Comprehensive but flexible schema supporting diverse invoice formats while providing confidence scoring for downstream validation.

### Stateless Design (NFR-004)

**Decision**: No database or file persistence in v1
**Rationale**: Simplifies privacy compliance and reduces infrastructure complexity
**Trade-off**: No user history or invoice storage (acceptable for v1 prototype)

### GPT-4o Selection

**Decision**: Use GPT-4o Vision API for all formats (PDF, image, text)
**Rationale**: Unified approach leveraging strong OCR and semantic understanding
**Alternative Considered**: Separate OCR (Tesseract) + NLP pipeline ‚Üí rejected for complexity

## Risk Mitigation Tracking

### RSK-001: GPT OCR Misreads Low-Quality Scans

```yaml
Severity: High
Mitigation Strategy:
  - Implement confidence_score in meta field
  - Test with diverse quality samples
  - Document limitations in API response
Agent: deep-debugger (if accuracy issues arise)
Testing: test-runner validates edge cases
```

### RSK-002: Schema Mismatch with Future ERP Systems

```yaml
Severity: Medium
Mitigation Strategy:
  - Version schema in output (meta.model_version)
  - Document schema extensibility
  - Plan for v2 mapping layer
Documentation: Include in TRD
```

---

## Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy

```yaml
main: Production-ready code only
feature/*: Development work
  - feature/backend-api
  - feature/frontend-ui
  - feature/gpt4o-integration
  - feature/deployment

NEVER:
  - Modify code on main branch
  - Force push without approval
  - Skip quality gates
```

### Commit Standards

```yaml
Format: Conventional Commits
Examples:
  - "feat(api): add file upload endpoint (REQ-001)"
  - "feat(parser): integrate GPT-4o semantic extraction (REQ-002)"
  - "test(api): add file validation tests (NFR-003)"
  - "docs(prd): clarify privacy requirements (NFR-004)"
